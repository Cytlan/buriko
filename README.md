Buriko General Interpreter
==========================

This project aims to reverse-engineer the Ethornell Buriko General Interpreter (BGI), and create an open source re-implementation of the engine.

Currently the goal is to re-implement the engine in Javascript and make it possible to run Ethornell games in the browser.

For now, all reverse-engineering efforts are based on the version of BGI found in the Lump of Sugar visual novel Nursery Rhyme (`Ethornell - Buriko General Interpreter ver 1.64 ( build : 398.3 )`). The tools may work with other games, but you'll likely run into problems fairly quickly.

This is a clean-room reverse engineering project, and we have no intention of facilitating piracy, therefore no files from any games are included in this repository and must be acquired elsewhere.

Technical documentation
-----------------------

You can find technical information about the engine in the `Technical.md` file. Note that this is still a work in progress, and the file will change as we learn more about the engine.
